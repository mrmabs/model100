Some code from my Tandy TRS-80 Model 100/102 adventures.

These files should be renamed and uploaded with the .DO extension, the file name .BAS is to make files readable with syntax highlighting github.

- **TFTCH.bas**: Simple system information program, built on the Model 100. Needs a model detection routine.
